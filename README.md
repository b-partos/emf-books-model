# emf-books-model
A model representing books and the associated metadata on the file system.

## Setup
The project was initally created using the EMF oriented Eclipse build.

The `.genmodel` file was reconfigured to generate both edit and model classes into the `src/` folder.

The `pom.xml` was manually configured and maven build is handled via the command line (gitbash).
